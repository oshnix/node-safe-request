# ssrf-free-request

Library that prevents ssrf in server-side requests.    
Inspired by [safe-request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-request) 
and [paranoid-request](https://github.com/uber-common/paranoid-request).

This lib is aimed to fix a number of problems other libs have.    
In addition, it should use only native NodeJS modules
